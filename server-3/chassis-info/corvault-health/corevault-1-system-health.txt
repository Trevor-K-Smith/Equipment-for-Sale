System Information
------------------
System Name: Uninitialized Name
System Contact: Uninitialized Contact
System Location: Uninitialized Location
System Information: Uninitialized Info
Midplane Serial Number: 00C0FF6446DE
Vendor Name: 
Product ID: 6575
Product Brand: 
Enclosure Count: 1
Health: Degraded
Health Reason: A subcomponent of this component is unhealthy.
Other MC Status: Operational
PFU Status: Idle

  Unhealthy Component
  -------------------
  Component ID: Enclosure 0, Controller A, Network Port
  Health: Degraded
  Health Reason: The network port Ethernet cable is unplugged, or the network is inoperable.
  Health Recommendation: - Check that the network port (the management Ethernet port) is properly connected to the network.
- If it is, restarting the Management Controller (MC) in the controller module that contains this port may resolve the problem.
- If not, check for network problems.
    - This fault may be caused by equipment outside of the storage system, such as faulty cabling or a faulty Ethernet switch.
    - If this fault is being reported by only one controller in a dual-controller system, swap the network-port Ethernet cables between the two controllers. This will show whether the problem is outside or inside the storage system.
    - If the problem is not outside of the storage system, replace the controller module with the faulty network port.

  Unhealthy Component
  -------------------
  Component ID: Enclosure 0, Power Supply 1
  Health: Fault
  Health Reason: The power supply is not receiving any input power.
  Health Recommendation: - Check that the power supply module has its switch turned on (if equipped with a switch) and the power cable is firmly plugged into both the power supply and a functional electrical outlet.
- If this does not resolve the problem and if the error persists, replace the power supply.

  Unhealthy Component
  -------------------
  Component ID: Disk Group dg01
  Health: Fault
  Health Reason: The disk group is quarantined.
  Health Recommendation: - Look for events in the event log related to quarantine (172, 485, or 590) and follow the recommended actions for those events.
