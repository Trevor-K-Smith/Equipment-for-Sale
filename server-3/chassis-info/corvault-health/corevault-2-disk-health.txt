  Action 
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  The system determined that the indicated disk is degraded because it experienced a number of disk errors in excess of a configured threshold. 
  - Monitor the disk.
  
  The disk is degraded due to a pending or active preemptive reconstruct operation.
