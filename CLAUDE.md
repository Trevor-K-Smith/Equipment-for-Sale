# Equipment for Sale

This repository lists server hardware that Trevor K Smith personally owns and wants to sell. Each server gets its own spec sheet (e.g., `server-specs.md`) and a summary entry in the README.

When new servers are added:
- Create or update a spec sheet with full hardware details (chassis, CPUs, RAM, GPUs, storage, networking)
- Add a summary table entry to README.md
- Update CHANGELOG.md with the new listing
