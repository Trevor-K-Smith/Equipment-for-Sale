System Information
------------------
System Name: Uninitialized Name
System Contact: Uninitialized Contact
System Location: Uninitialized Location
System Information: Uninitialized Info
Midplane Serial Number: 00C0FF6447AA
Vendor Name: 
Product ID: 6575
Product Brand: 
Enclosure Count: 1
Health: Degraded
Health Reason: A subcomponent of this component is unhealthy.
Other MC Status: Operational
PFU Status: Idle

  Unhealthy Component
  -------------------
  Component ID: Enclosure 0, Controller A, Network Port
  Health: Degraded
  Health Reason: The network port Ethernet cable is unplugged, or the network is inoperable.
  Health Recommendation: - Check that the network port (the management Ethernet port) is properly connected to the network.
- If it is, restarting the Management Controller (MC) in the controller module that contains this port may resolve the problem.
- If not, check for network problems.
    - This fault may be caused by equipment outside of the storage system, such as faulty cabling or a faulty Ethernet switch.
    - If this fault is being reported by only one controller in a dual-controller system, swap the network-port Ethernet cables between the two controllers. This will show whether the problem is outside or inside the storage system.
    - If the problem is not outside of the storage system, replace the controller module with the faulty network port.

  Unhealthy Component
  -------------------
  Component ID: Enclosure 0, Power Supply 1
  Health: Fault
  Health Reason: The power supply is not receiving any input power.
  Health Recommendation: - Check that the power supply module has its switch turned on (if equipped with a switch) and the power cable is firmly plugged into both the power supply and a functional electrical outlet.
- If this does not resolve the problem and if the error persists, replace the power supply.

  Unhealthy Component
  -------------------
  Component ID: Disk 0.76
  Health: Fault
  Health Reason: The disk has a probable hardware failure.
  Health Recommendation: - Replace the disk with one of the same type (SSD, enterprise SAS, or midline SAS) and the same or greater capacity. For continued optimum I/O performance, the replacement disk should have performance that is the same as or better than the one it is replacing.

  Unhealthy Component
  -------------------
  Component ID: Enclosure 0, Slot 76
  Health: Degraded
  Health Reason: The disk in this slot or the midplane is degraded.
  Health Recommendation: - Replace the disk with one of the same type (SSD, enterprise SAS, or midline SAS) and the same or greater capacity. For continued optimum I/O performance, the replacement disk should have performance that is the same as or better than the one it is replacing.
- If this does not resolve the problem, replace the chassis FRU.

  Unhealthy Component
  -------------------
  Component ID: Disk Group dg01
  Health: Degraded
  Health Reason: One disk in the RAID disk group failed during disk-group initalization; however, the disk group remains fault tolerant.
  Health Recommendation: - If a spare disk is configured that can be used for reconstructing this disk group, reconstruction will begin automatically when initialization completes. Do the following:
    - Replace the failed disk. (Look for event 8 in the event log to determine which disk failed and for advice on replacing it.)
    - Configure the new disk as a spare so the system can use it in the future if another disk failure occurs.
- If no spare disk is configured that can be used for reconstructing this disk group, do the following:
    - Replace the failed disk. (Look for event 8 in the event log to determine which disk failed and for advice on replacing it.)
    - Configure the new disk as a spare so the system can start reconstructing the disk group as soon as initialization completes.
    - To prevent this problem in the future, configure one or more additional disks as spare disks.

    - Replace the failed disk. (Look for event 8 in the event log to determine which disk failed and for advice on replacing it.)

    - Configure the new disk as a spare so the system can start reconstructing the disk group as soon as initialization completes.
    - To prevent this problem in the future, configure one or more additional disks as spare disks.
   The spare capacity available to the ADAPT disk group is not sufficient to meet the required configured spare capacity that is needed to provide full fault tolerance. Spare capacity availability can be influenced by operations that require available space in the system, such as reconstructing data from a failed disk.
  - Add disks to the disk group, or replace any disks that may have failed. The system will automatically increase the spare capacity to meet the requirements placed on the system by the target spare capacity.
